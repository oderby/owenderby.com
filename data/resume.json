    "about": "A self-motivated, versatile software engineer with strong product sensibilities and leadership skills. Collaborative, thorough and quick to learn new tools. Results and impact are more important to me than technology used. Based in Oakland, CA and looking exclusively at climate tech companies.",
    "summary": "Hi, I'm Owen Derby. I'm a staff software engineer.\n\nI like solving problems and fixing things. Whether it's tracking down a bug or building new services, I'm adept at jumping into a variety of different projects and producing results. While I prefer building backends and architecting systems, I'm not afraid of the occasional JS/HTML/CSS. Currently, I'm really enjoying using Terraform to manage infrastructure resources in code. Detail-oriented and thorough, I take pride in my work.\n\nWhen I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, playing basketball, and challenging friends to board games. I also care about having a positive impact on our planet and society."
