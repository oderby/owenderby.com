    "about": "A self-motivated, versatile software engineer with strong product sensibilities. Collaborative, thorough and quick to learn new tools. Results and impact are more important to me than technology used. Seeking opportunities at a company leveraging technology to tackle climate change or other equally important challenges.",
    "summary": "I'm an engineer: I like solving problems and fixing things. Whether it's tracking down a bug or building new services, I'm adept at jumping into a variety of different projects and producing results. I prefer building backends and systems, but find myself producing a lot of javascript lately (a necessary evil of building things for the web). Detail-oriented and thorough, I take pride in my work.\n\nWhen I'm not working, I like traveling, taking photos, and playing a variety of games with friends (so long as the game involves more thinking than randomness). I also care about having a positive impact on our planet and society. Currently, I'm helping build and run [5calls.org](https://5calls.org), but I am always looking for other ways to get involved.\n\nI'm actively seeking new full-time engineering opportunities at this time. If you have a role you'd like to discuss, please [get in touch](mailto:me@owenderby.com). While I'm most passionate about having an impact on climate change, I'm interested in any opportunity to have an impact outside this little tech bubble which I occupy."
