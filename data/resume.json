        "summary": "I'm an engineer: I like solving problems and fixing things. Whether it's tracking down a bug or building a new sub-system, I'm adept at jumping into a variety of different projects and producing results. I prefer building backends and systems, but find myself producing a lot of javascript lately (a necessary evil of building things for the web). Detail-oriented and thorough, I take pride in my work.\n\nWhen I'm not working, I like traveling, taking photos, and playing a variety of games with friends (so long as it involves more thinking than randomness). I'm also a ping-pong enthusiast, and have been known join in the occasional pick-up basketball or soccer game. Currently, I'm contributing actively to the [5calls](https://5calls.org) project and finding ways to empower my peers to be better citizens."
