# Owen Derby's Website

This repository is my personal website. I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to
compile the source into a static website in the `docs/` directory. The latest
website can always be found at [https://owenderby.com](https://owenderby.com).

I followed these tutorials ([1](http://www.moxie.io/post/static-websites-with-hugo-on-google-cloud-storage/) [2](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/)) to get up and running with Hugo.
